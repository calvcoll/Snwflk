#Snwflk
Snwflk is a switcher currently being developed, to enable easy switching between styles for Tweetdeck, created by FractalHexagon and myself.
It has been developed as a Chrome extension and should easily be able to loaded as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
The popup poge, as well as the options page are dynamically generated using the React framework, with the options page styling mainly using Chrome-Bootstrap.

DO NOT EDIT ANY JS FOLDER FILES THAT ARE IN THE JSX FOLDER WITH THE EXTENSION JSX

This is due to these files being dynamically generated via react-tools' jsx program.
Other than that everything should be fair game.
