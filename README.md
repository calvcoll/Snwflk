#Snwflk
Snwflk is a switcher currently being developed, to enable easy switching between styles for Tweetdeck, created by FractalHexagon and myself.
It has been developed as a Chrome extension and should easily be able to loaded as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
The popup poge, as well as the options page are dynamically generated using the React framework, with the options page styling mainly using Chrome-Bootstrap.

#Contributions
**Do not edit any files in the JS folder, these are dynamically generated.**

`npm install` should install the dependencies
`npm run transform-to-js` should transform the jsx folder files to js
`npm run constant-transform-to-js` should keep watch of changing jsx files and create js files whilst developing.
